It was built in 1848 A.D. at an estimated cost of 10 lakh rupees by a rich merchant Sheth Hutheesing as a dedication to the 15th Jain tirthankar, Shri Dharmanatha. Traditional artisans working in stone belonged to the Sonpura & Salat communities. The Salat community constructed masterpieces of architecture ranging from forts, palaces to temples. The work of the Hutheesing Jain temple is attributed to Premchand Salat. One scholar has remarked, \"Each part goes on increasing in dignity as we approach the sanctuary. Whether looked at from its courts or from the outside, it possesses variety without confusion and an appropriateness of every part to the purpose for which it was intended.\"<br \/>Located outside the Delhi Gate, the temple is spread over a sprawling courtyard, a mandapa surmounted by a large ridged dome, which is supported by 12 ornate pillars. The small garbhagruh (main shrine) on the east end reaches up into three stunningly carved spires and encircled by 52 small shrines dedicated to the various Tirthankars. There are large protuding porches with magnificently decorated columns and figural brackets on three outer sides. Also a recently built 78 ft Mahavir stambha (tower) fashioned after the renowned tower at Chittor in Rajasthan, flanks the outer courtyard by the front entrance. Some of the motifs used in the design reminds one of the Sultanate minarets of the Mughal period.","latlong": "23.039568,72.566005","additional_info": "","photos": [{"title": "","url": "","id": ""},{}],"id": "1111"},

Built in 1573, it is the last of the major mosques to be built in Ahmedabad under the Mughal rule. Surrounded by busy intersections, it presents a stark contrast to speeding buses and giant advertisements.<br \/>The carved jaalis in the windows of the western wall are known worldwide and have become a symbol of the city of Ahmedabad. Depicting a tree with intertwining branches, the carvings look like fine lace filigree work, but are hewn from solid stone. Though much smaller than the Jama Masjid, and lacking the enclosed courtyard, the craftsmanship of this mosque places it on a level nearly unequaled in the world.","latlong": "23.028368,72.578205","additional_info": "","photos": [{"title": "","url": "","id": ""},{}],"id": "1112"},

In 1822, the land was given by the British government to do so, and Swaminarayan himself entrusted the responsibility for the construction of the temple to Ananandanand Swami.<br \/>The temple is carved in Burmese teak, and every arch and bracket is painted with bright colors, a defining characteristic of Swaminarayan temples everywhere. There are several idols installed by Swaminarayan himself, as well as a display of some of his personal items and sculptures. In the adjoining haveli, there are quarters for pilgrims of the sect, a special section for women, and an area where ceremonies and teaching sessions are held for women only. Located near Kalupur in the eastern part of the old city, the Swaminarayan Temple is a splash of color in the midst of the city√≠s grey and is also the starting point for the Heritage Walk through the pols of the old city.","location_address": "Near Kalupur in the eastern part of the Old City","latlong": "23.085891,72.496033","additional_info": "Address:<br \/>Near Kalupur in the eastern part of the Old City<br \/>Timings:<br \/>Open to public every day from 6:00am - 7:00pm","photos": [{"title": "","url": "","id": ""},{}],"id": "1113"},

		{"hub": "Ahmedabad Metro","area": "Ahmedabad","type": "Religious Sites","name": "Mahudi Jain Temple","description": "This derasar, considered to be one of the most sacred Jain pilgrimages, is situated in Mahudi, Mehsana District, and spreads over an area of 2 square kilometers. In ancient times, the place was known as Madhumati. The idols and artistic remains recovered from the ground show that the history of this place is nearly 2000 years old, based on the inscriptions in Brahmi script. Acharyadev Buddhi Sagarsurisvarji was inspired in a dream to install the idol of Ghantakarna Mahavir Dev in 1923 A.D. This idol is considered to have miraculous powers. Thousands of Jain devotees, as well as devotees from other backgrounds, come to receive blessings from this idol.<br \/>Ghantakarna Mahavir was a Kshatriya (warrior) king named Tungabhadra in his previous birth and considered to be the protector of the less fortunate. So even today his idol carries his weapons a bow and arrow. It is always said that in his previous birth he was very fond of sukhadi, and so there is a tradition of all visitors offering sukhadi to him during the prayer. However, it is believed that the sukhadi should be consumed or donated before leaving the premises, otherwise it might bring bad luck.<br \/>Next to this shrine is a bell on a height of about 30 feet and devotees climb up to ring it and ask for the fulfillment of a wish. In this vicinity there is another larger temple with a 22-inch marble idol of Bhagawan Padmaprabhu sitting in padmasana (lotus) posture, installed by Acharyadev. It is customary to take a bhoomti (circumambulation) around the 24 shrines of the tirthankaras here. The nearest railway station of Vijapur is 10 kms away. There are good bus facilities to get to Mahudi from Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Kalol.","latlong": "23.198436,72.406082","additional_info": "","photos": [{"title": "","url": "","id": ""},{}],"id": "1115"},
