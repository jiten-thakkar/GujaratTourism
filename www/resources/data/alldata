{"location_hub":"Ahmedabad Metro","location_area":"Ahmedabad","location_type":"Religious Sites","location_name":"Hutheesing Jain Temple","location_description":"This remarkably elegant temple created out of white marble has been sacred to many Jain families, generation after generation. It was built in 1848 A.D. at an estimated cost of 10 lakh rupees by a rich merchant Sheth Hutheesing as a dedication to the 15th Jain tirthankar, Shri Dharmanatha. Traditional artisans working in stone belonged to the Sonpura & Salat communities. The Salat community constructed masterpieces of architecture ranging from forts, palaces to temples. The work of the Hutheesing Jain temple is attributed to Premchand Salat. One scholar has remarked, "Each part goes on increasing in dignity as we approach the sanctuary. Whether looked at from its courts or from the outside, it possesses variety without confusion and an appropriateness of every part to the purpose for which it was intended."<br />Located outside the Delhi Gate, the temple is spread over a sprawling courtyard, a mandapa surmounted by a large ridged dome, which is supported by 12 ornate pillars. The small garbhagruh (main shrine) on the east end reaches up into three stunningly carved spires and encircled by 52 small shrines dedicated to the various Tirthankars. There are large protuding porches with magnificently decorated columns and figural brackets on three outer sides. Also a recently built 78 ft Mahavir stambha (tower) fashioned after the renowned tower at Chittor in Rajasthan, flanks the outer courtyard by the front entrance. Some of the motifs used in the design reminds one of the Sultanate minarets of the Mughal period.","location_address":"","location_coords":"23.039568,72.566005","location_timings":"","location_fees":"","location_facilities":"","location_note":"","location_lastupdated":"","location_contact":"","id":15362},
{"location_hub":"Ahmedabad Metro","location_area":"Ahmedabad","location_type":"Religious Sites","location_name":"Sidi Sayeed Masjid","location_description":"Off the eastern end of Nehru bridge stands the Sidi Sayeed mosque. Built in 1573, it is the last of the major mosques to be built in Ahmedabad under the Mughal rule. Surrounded by busy intersections, it presents a stark contrast to speeding buses and giant advertisements.<br />The carved jaalis in the windows of the western wall are known worldwide and have become a symbol of the city of Ahmedabad. Depicting a tree with intertwining branches, the carvings look like fine lace filigree work, but are hewn from solid stone. Though much smaller than the Jama Masjid, and lacking the enclosed courtyard, the craftsmanship of this mosque places it on a level nearly unequaled in the world.","location_address":"","location_coords":"23.028368,72.578205","location_timings":"","location_fees":"","location_facilities":"","location_note":"","location_lastupdated":"","location_contact":"","id":16285},
{"location_hub":"Ahmedabad Metro","location_area":"Ahmedabad","location_type":"Religious Sites","location_name":"Swaminarayan Temple","location_description":"This temple is the first temple of the Swaminarayan sect to have been built. In 1822, the land was given by the British government to do so, and Swaminarayan himself entrusted the responsibility for the construction of the temple to Ananandanand Swami.<br />The temple is carved in Burmese teak, and every arch and bracket is painted with bright colors, a defining characteristic of Swaminarayan temples everywhere. There are several idols installed by Swaminarayan himself, as well as a display of some of his personal items and sculptures. In the adjoining haveli, there are quarters for pilgrims of the sect, a special section for women, and an area where ceremonies and teaching sessions are held for women only. Located near Kalupur in the eastern part of the old city, the Swaminarayan Temple is a splash of color in the midst of the cityís grey and is also the starting point for the Heritage Walk through the pols of the old city.","location_address":"Near Kalupur in the eastern part of the Old City","location_coords":"23.085891,72.496033","location_timings":"Open to public every day from 6:00am - 7:00pm","location_fees":"","location_facilities":"","location_note":"","location_lastupdated":"","location_contact":"","id":15370},
{"location_hub":"Ahmedabad Metro","location_area":"Ahmedabad","location_type":"Religious Sites","location_name":"Jama Masjid","location_description":"Just west of Manek Chowk stands the magnificent Jama Masjid (Friday Mosque), built in 1423 during the reign of Ahmedabadís founder Ahmed Shah I. While all around the mosque lies the hectic frenzy of the center of the old city, step through the gates (on the north, east and south sides) and the urban chaos falls away behind you, leaving you standing in a refuge of profound serenity, accompanied only by people in quiet prayer, and birds perching on the columns.<br />The wide open courtyard, floored with white marble, is ringed by a columned arcade painted with giant Arabic calligraphy, and has a tank for ritual ablutions in the center. The mosque and arcades are built of beautiful yellow sandstone and carved with the intricate detail that mosques of this period are known for. While the two principal minarets flanking the main arched entranceway collapsed in the 1819 earthquake, their lower portions still stand. The main prayer hall has over 260 columns supporting the roof, with its 15 domes, making a walk through the hall a beautiful maze of light and shadows. In its Indo-Saracenic architecture, the mosque also contains many syncretic elements not necessarily obvious to the viewer: some of the central domes are carved like lotus flowers, closely related to the typical domes of Jain temples; and some of the pillars are carved with the form of a bell hanging on a chain, in reference to the bells that often hang in Hindu temples. On one of the innermost windows there is even a carving of an \'Om\' symbol.<br />Like at all religious sites, take proper care to be respectful of othersí beliefs; this is, after all, a current place of worship. Visitors are welcomed, but should maintain the quiet contemplative atmosphere, remove their shoes, and not disturb those in prayer. During prayer times, you should keep your head covered and women should not enter the main hall.","location_address":"","location_coords":"23.086364,72.323341","location_timings":"","location_fees":"","location_facilities":"","location_note":"","location_lastupdated":"","location_contact":"","id":16181},
{"location_hub":"Ahmedabad Metro","location_area":"Ahmedabad","location_type":"Religious Sites","location_name":"Mahudi Jain Temple","location_description":"This derasar, considered to be one of the most sacred Jain pilgrimages, is situated in Mahudi, Mehsana District, and spreads over an area of 2 square kilometers. In ancient times, the place was known as Madhumati. The idols and artistic remains recovered from the ground show that the history of this place is nearly 2000 years old, based on the inscriptions in Brahmi script. Acharyadev Buddhi Sagarsurisvarji was inspired in a dream to install the idol of Ghantakarna Mahavir Dev in 1923 A.D. This idol is considered to have miraculous powers. Thousands of Jain devotees, as well as devotees from other backgrounds, come to receive blessings from this idol.<br />Ghantakarna Mahavir was a Kshatriya (warrior) king named Tungabhadra in his previous birth and considered to be the protector of the less fortunate. So even today his idol carries his weapons a bow and arrow. It is always said that in his previous birth he was very fond of sukhadi, and so there is a tradition of all visitors offering sukhadi to him during the prayer. However, it is believed that the sukhadi should be consumed or donated before leaving the premises, otherwise it might bring bad luck.<br />Next to this shrine is a bell on a height of about 30 feet and devotees climb up to ring it and ask for the fulfillment of a wish. In this vicinity there is another larger temple with a 22-inch marble idol of Bhagawan Padmaprabhu sitting in padmasana (lotus) posture, installed by Acharyadev. It is customary to take a bhoomti (circumambulation) around the 24 shrines of the tirthankaras here. The nearest railway station of Vijapur is 10 kms away. There are good bus facilities to get to Mahudi from Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Kalol.","location_address":"","location_coords":"23.198436,72.406082","location_timings":"","location_fees":"","location_facilities":"","location_note":"","location_lastupdated":"","location_contact":"","id":15399},
